                        <p class="paragraph-sub">In 1995, after 11 years working at the Computer Science Lab of Xerox
                        PARC, Pradeep Sindhu took a leave of absence to consider his next steps. Noting the explosive
                        growth of the Internet and the importance of connecting computers, Sindhu was struck by the
                        enormous potential of the router — the fundamental building block of the network. He returned
                        from a vacation with the idea to start a company to supply high-performance routers to support
                        the quickly emerging Internet.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph paragraph-medium spaced-bottom">After some discouraging responses from venture capitalists, Sindhu managed to secure financing for his company, and Juniper Networks was incorporated February 6, 1996, in California. Instead of starting small like many startups, Juniper Networks decided upon what would become its signature approach — tackle the toughest problem and solve it once.</p><p class="paragraph paragraph-medium spaced-bottom">The company’s first product, the revolutionary M40 router which shipped in September of 1998, did just that. The M40 far surpassed all other routers on the market and established Juniper’s position as an innovative and serious player in the hardware market.</p><p class="paragraph paragraph-medium spaced-bottom">Developing the M40 was a major undertaking that required two years of research and work. During that time, to keep venture capitalists and customers happy, Juniper Networks developed what would later become its major differentiator and the basis for all future innovation — Junos Platform.</p><p class="paragraph paragraph-medium spaced-bottom">Since this auspicious beginning, Juniper Networks has continued to grow and innovate, releasing new product, developing new technologies based on customer’s needs, and remaining at the forefront of high-performance networking.</p><p class="paragraph paragraph-medium spaced-bottom">Juniper Networks went public on June 25, 1999. It was one of the most successful initial public offerings in history.</p><p class="paragraph paragraph-medium spaced-bottom"></p>
