                    that is provided for USG-authorized use only.  By using this IS (which includes any device attached
                    to this IS), you consent to the following conditions: </p>

                <p class="text-sm-left text-muted h5">-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this
                    IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network
                    operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE) , and counterintelligence
                    (CI) investigations.</p>

                <p class="text-sm-left text-muted h5">-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.</p>

                <p class="text-sm-left text-muted h5">-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private,
                    are subject to routing monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any
                    USG-authorized purpose.</p>

                <p class="text-sm-left text-muted h5">-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and
                    access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.</p>

                <p class="text-sm-left text-muted h5">-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute
                    consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged
                    communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys,
                    psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants.</p>

                <p class="text-sm-left text-muted h5">Such communications and work product are private and confidential.</p>
