The CTP Series has the field- proven flexibility, performance and reliability required for circuit applications. The CTP Series technology includes many advanced clocking options and per-circuit buffers to enable end- to-end timing and the removal\r\nof jitter to create a psuedowire across the IP/MPLS network. The CTP Series enables customers to connect digital and analog voice applications easily and reliably across the IP network using circuit emulation over IP, bringing them the advantages of converged multiservice IP networking without the complexities and cost of upgrades required for VoIP. The CTP Series bridges the legacy and IP world and provides many unique features that enable cost reduction by eliminating point-to-point circuits and convergence of all applications onto one IP/MPLS network.",
